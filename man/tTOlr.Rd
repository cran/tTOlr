\title{Maximum Likelihood ratio for H1 versus H0, given t-statistic or p-value}
\usage{
tTOlr(
  t = NULL,
  df = NULL,
  nsamp = NULL,
  pval = NULL,
  delta = NULL,
  sd = 1,
  twoSided = TRUE,
  showMax = TRUE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{t}{\code{t}-statistic.  If \code{NULL}, this is calculated
from the \code{p}-value.}

\item{df}{Degrees of freedom.}

\item{nsamp}{Sample size.  For a two-sample test, this should be
a vector of length 2.}

\item{pval}{\code{p}-value.  If \code{NULL}, this is calculated
from the \code{t}-statistic and degreesÂ of freedom.}

\item{delta}{If not \code{NULL}, this specifies the $t$-statistic
for the difference from H0 that is of interest, allowing the
calculation of the corresponding likelihood and likelihood ratio.}

\item{sd}{Standard deviation.}

\item{twoSided}{Set either to \code{TRUE} for a two-sided test,
or \code{FALSE} for a one-sided test.}

\item{showMax}{Set to \code{TRUE} if the maximum of the likelihood
and the likelihood ratio is required.}
}
\value{
List, with elements
 \itemize{
 \item t - \code{t}-statistic
 \item df - Degrees of freedom
 \item pval - P-value
 \item likDelta - Likelihood, given difference delta under H0
 \item lrDelta - Likelihood ratio, given difference delta under H0
 \item maxlik - Maximum likelihood, under allowed alternatives H1
 \item lrmax - Maximum likelihood under H1, on the scale of the
 $t$-statistic
 \item tmax - \code{t}-statistic for difference in means
 that makes likelihood under H1 a maximum
 }
}
\description{
Given the \code{t}-statistic for a difference in means,
or for a mean difference, and degrees of freedom,
determine the maximum likelihood under the alternative
H1, and the $t$-statistic for the difference in means
that makes the likelihood under H1 a maximum. Also
available is the likelihood that corresponds to  a
particular value of a particular effect size (mean
divided by standard deviation) \code{delta}.
}
\details{
The function returns the maximum likelihood estimate
of the maximum likelihood on the scale of the $t$-statistic,
for the likelihood under the alternative, when the
when the $t$-statistic is used as non-centrality parameter.
This results in a value for the likelihood ratio that differs
from (and is smaller than) the standard likelihood ratio
statistic. Additionally, return the likelihoods under H0 and H1.
}
\note{
The likelihood estimate for H1 versus H0 is unchanged if
the roles of H0 and H1 are reversed.
