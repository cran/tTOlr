# Introduction {-}

Under NULL hypothesis assumptions, $p$-values are uniformly
distributed on the unit interval.  The common $p \leq 0.05$
strategy for rejecting the NULL hypothesis is justified by
a probability for this, under the NULL, that equals 0.05.
$P$-values are often misinterpreted.  The notes that follow
draw attention to common misunderstandings, and compare
and contrast $p$-values with the insights likelihood based 
statistics provide.

The $p$-value probability $p$ relates only to what can be 
expected under the NULL.  For tests that are based on 
$t$-statistics, a $p$-value that equals 0.05 translates to 
a maximum likelihood ratio that, for degrees of freedom 
greater than 5, is less than 5.

Decimal numbers that are shown on graphs are given to two
significant figures.  In the text, they may be given
three significant figures.

# Basic properties of $p$-values

```{r cap1, echo=FALSE}
cap1 <- "Under the NULL hypothesis, and assuming
distributional assumptions are correct, $p$-values are uniformly
distributed on the unit interval. The strip plots each show the
distribution of values in a random sample of $p$-values, under
NULL hypothesis assumptions.  The ordering from 1 to 0 reflects
the decrease in the $p$-value, for commonly used test statistics, 
as the absolute value of the test statistic increases. Values 
less than the commonly used 0.05 threshold are shown in red."
```

$P$-values are commonly used within a Null Hypothesis
Significance Testing (NHST) framework.  This approach to 
statistical decision making sets up a choice between a null
hypothesis, commonly written H$_0$, and alternative H$_1$,
with the calculated $p$-value used to decide whether H$_0$
should be rejected in favour of H$_1$.  Commonly, H$_0$
is the hypothesis that a difference of means, or a mean
difference, has been drawn from a population with mean
$\mu = 0$.  In a medical context, a treatment of interest 
may be compared with a placebo. Then

* Given H$_0$, the $p$-value is uniformly distributed on the
interval $0 \leq p \leq 1$
     + As a consequence, for any $\alpha$, 
     P[p $\leq \alpha$ | H$_0$] = $\alpha$
* Under H$_1$, the $p$-value is designed to increase as the
     difference from H$_0$ increases.
     
More informative than to report $p \leq 0.05$ is to give a 95%
confidence interval for the mean.  The NULL hypothesis is rejected
at a level of $\alpha = 0.05$ if and only if the interval does
not contain 0.

Figure \@ref(fig:H0) shows the distributions of values for five
random samples drawn from the uniform distribution on the interval
from 1 to 0.  The ordering from 1 to 0 is designed to reflect the
decrease in $p$-value with increasing absolute value of the $t$
or other such statistic.

```{r H0, fig.width=5.75, fig.height=2.25, out.width='98%', fig.show='hold', fig.cap=cap1, echo=FALSE}
set.seed(17)
rr <- data.frame(x=runif(500), gp=rep(rev(letters[1:5]),rep(100,5)))
panelfun <- function(x,y,...){
                  x1 <- x[x>0.05]
                  y1 <- y[x>0.05]
                  x2 <- x[x<=0.05]
                  y2 <- y[x<=0.05]
                  panel.dotplot(x1,y1,...);
                  panel.dotplot(x2,y2,..., col='red');
                  panel.axis(side = "bottom", at=0.05, outside=TRUE, 
                             ticks=TRUE);
                  panel.abline(v=0.05, col='gray')
}
atx <- c(seq(from=1,to=.2, by=-.2),0.05)
gph <- dotplot(gp~x, data=rr, pch='|', alpha=1, panel=panelfun, 
               xlim=c(1,0), xlab=expression(italic(p)*'-value'), 
               ylab='',scales=list(x=list(at=atx), y=list(draw=F)))
update(gph, main=list("Five random samples of 100 from the uniform", 
                 font=1, y=-1, cex=0.8))
```

Under H$_0$, a fraction $\alpha$ of $p$-values from independent
replications of an experiment will, on average, be less than $\alpha$.
Figure \@ref(fig:H0), with values less than 0.05 shown in red, is
designed to highlight this point for $\alpha$=0.05 .  The values
in the first and second samples that are $\leq$ 0.05 are, to three 
decimal places.

```{r lt5pc, echo=FALSE}
cat(rev(sort(with(rr, round(subset(x, x<=0.05 & gp=='a'), 3)))))
cat(rev(sort(with(rr, round(subset(x, x<=0.05 & gp=='b'), 3)))))
```

Values that are less than $\alpha$ (in the figure, $\alpha$=0.05)
are sampled from a uniform distribution on the interval from
 $\alpha$ to 0.
    
The calculated $p$-value provides more nuanced evidence than
comes from merely noting whether it is less than $\alpha$, 
typically with $\alpha$ = 0.05.  A calculated value $p$ is, 
however, at the upper end of the range of values that under 
H$_0$ occur with probability $p$.  It is, under H$_0$, 
the expected value for $p$-values that are in the interval
that extends from 0 to $\alpha = 2p$. This suggests that 

* If $p$ = 0.05, it is the expected value, under Under H$_0$,
of values that range from 0 to 0.1, and that occur with a 
frequency of 0.1 (or 10%).
* Note, however!  Under H$_1$, the distribution is no longer 
uniform, and the range of values for which a calculated value
$p$ is the expected value will change.
    + Doubling the calculated $p$-value, in order to get an
    equivalent that on average corresponds to the "Reject
    H$_0$ when $p < \alpha$ strategy will then, on average,
    lead to a different rejection rate when the NULL is
    false!

Rather that making such sense as one can of of the calculated
$p$-value, a better approach is to work with likelihood ratios.
    
## Wear comparison for two shoe materials {#wear}

Data from an experiment that compares results from a treatment
with a baseline provides a relatively simple setting in which to 
probe the interpretation that should be placed on a given $p$-value.
Even in this 'simple' setting, the issues that arise for the
interpretation of a $p$-value, and its implication for the credence
that shouldÂ be given to a claimed difference, are non-trivial.

The `MASS::shoes` dataset compares, for each of ten boys, 
the wear on two different shoe materials.  Materials A and B 
were assigned at random to feet --- one to the left foot, and 
the other to the right.  It will be used as a relatively 
simple setting in which to probe the interpretation that 
should be placed on a given $p$-value.

The measurements of wear, and the differences for each 
boy, were:
```{r wear}
wear <- with(MASS::shoes, rbind(A,B,d=B-A))
colnames(wear) <- rep("",10)
wear
```

Here, the samples are paired  The differences will be
used for analysis, thus reducing the analysis to that
for a single sample $t$-test. The differences 
$d_i, i=1, 2, \ldots, n$ are then used for analysis. 
The $p$-value for testing for no difference is obtained 
by referring the $t$-statistic for the mean $\bar{d}$ of 
the $d_i$ to a $t$-distribution with $n-1$ degrees of freedom.  

The calculation assumes that the differences
$d_i, i=1, 2, \ldots 10$ have been independently drawn
from the same normal distribution.  The statistic 
$\sqrt{n} \, \bar{d}/s$, where $\bar{d}$ is the mean of the $d_i$,
and $s$ is the sample standard deviation,  can then be
treated as drawn from a $t$-distribution.
The $p$-value for a 2-sided test is then, assuming H0, and as 
any difference might in principle go in either direction

> the probability of occurrence of values of the 
$t$-statistic $t$ that are greater than or equal to
$\sqrt{n} \bar{d}/s$ in magnitude

Calculations proceed under the NULL hypothesis 
assumption that the differences are a random sample 
from a normal distribution with mean zero:
```{r shoes, echo=FALSE}
wear <- with(MASS::shoes, rbind(A, B, d=B-A))
library(magrittr)
shoeStats <- wear['d',] %>% 
  {list(Mean=mean(.), SD=sd(.), n=length(.))} %$%
  {c(., SEM=SD/sqrt(n), t=Mean*sqrt(n)/SD)} %$%
  {c(., pval=2*pt(t, df=n-1, lower.tail=FALSE), df=n-1)}
print(prettyNum(unlist(shoeStats), digits=3, dropTrailing=TRUE),
      quote=FALSE)
```

The $p$-value can then be interpreted in the following ways:

* We may have decided in advance to set a cutoff $\alpha$, then
lumping together all values less than $\alpha$
    + With $\alpha$ = 0.05, $p$ = `r round(shoeStats[['pval']],3)` 
would count as an event, under H$_0$, with probability 0.05  
    + With $\alpha$ = 0.01, this would count as an event, under H$_0$, 
with probability 0.01
* The calculated $p$-value presents a more nuanced picture.
The probability to which a value of magnitude $p$ then
relates is 2$p$ rather than $p$.  
    + The calculated $p$ is in the middle of the range 
    from 2$p$ to 0. The probability that a $p$-value
    will appear in that range is, under the NULL, 2$p$.
    
A 95% (two-sided) confidence interval for the `B-A` wear difference 
$\mu$ is

```{r CIs, echo=FALSE}
CI95 <- shoeStats[['Mean']] + c(-1,1)*qt(.975,9)*shoeStats[['SEM']]
CI99 <- shoeStats[['Mean']] + c(-1,1)*qt(.995,9)*shoeStats[['SEM']]
```

`shoeStats[['Mean']]` $\pm$ `qt(.97.5,9)*shoeStats[['SEM']]`  
i.e., `r round(CI95[1],3)` $< \mu <$ `r round(CI95[2],3)`

A 99% confidence interval is `r round(CI99[1],3)` $< \mu <$ `r round(CI99[2],3)`

## What $p$-values do not, and cannot, provide

* A $p$-value does not give the probability that the NULL
is false.
    + It is calculated under the assumption that the NULL 
    hypothesis is true. It does not tell us whether that 
hypothesis is correct!
* Nor does the $p$-value give the probability that the results 
occurred by chance.
    + In order to calculate this, one needs a prior estimate of
    the frequency with which, over independent repeats of the
    process that generated the data, true positives can be
    expected.

@resnick2017nerdy makes the point thus:

> The tricky point is then, that the $p$-value does not show how rare the results of an experiment are. Itâs how rare the results would be
in the world where the null hypothesis is true. That is, itâs how rare
the results would be if nothing in your experiment worked, and the difference ... was due to random chance alone.  The $p$-value
quantifies this rareness.

What one can say is that

> As the $p$-value becomes smaller, it becomes less likely
that the NULL hypothesis is true.

## Strategies for the use of $p$-values

### A binary choice is not always appropriate. {-}
There are many circumstances where it makes more sense to treat
the problem as one of estimation, with the estimate accompanied
with a measure of accuracy.

### One experiment may not, on its own, be enough {-}

Note comments from @fisher1935design, who introduced the 
use of $p$-values, on their proper use:

> No isolated experiment, however significant in itself, can suffice for the experimental demonstration of any natural phenomenon; for the âone chance in a millionâ will undoubtedly occur, with no less and no more than its appropriate frequency, however surprised we may be that it should occur to us. In order to assert that a natural phenomenon is experimentally demonstrable we need, not an isolated record, but a reliable method of procedure. In relation to the test of significance, we may say that a phenomenon is experimentally demonstrable when we know how to conduct an experiment which will rarely fail to give us a statistically significant result.

In other words, use $p$-values as a screening device, to identify
results that may merit further investigation.  This is very different
from the way that $p$-values have come to be used in most current
scientific discourse.  A $p$-value should be treated as a measure
of change in the weight of evidence, not a measure of the absolute 
weight of evidence.

An independent repetition of the experiment provides checks that
no statistical analysis can provide.  Such checks, which are
widedly neglected, are important for reasons that extend beyond
checking whether the initial $p \leq \alpha$ was a fluke. For
experimental data, they provide a check on biases that may arise
from mistakes in procedure.

When $p$-values are used to choose between a NULL and an
alternative, the focus is on how rare the "event" would be if
the NULL hypothesis is true.  There is no attention to assessing
how much more likely it would be if the NULL is false.
Likelihood ratios, which will now be discussed, do provide such
a comparison.  While the detailed discussion will be based
around tests and comparisons that work with $t$-statistics,
it will illustrate principles that apply more widely.

## Small differences may be of no interest

Irrespective of the threshold set for finding a difference,
both $p$ and the likelihood ratio will detect increasingly
small differences from the NULL as the sample size increases.
A way around this is to set a cutoff for the minimum
difference of interest, and calculate the difference 
relative to that cutoff.

### Effectiveness of soporofic drugs {-}

The use of a cutoff will be illustrated using the dataset
`datasets::sleep`. This has the increase in sleeping hours, 
on the same set of patients, on each of the two drugs. 
Consider first the result from a regular two-sided test
Data, with output from the $t$-test, are:
```{r sleep}
sleep2 <-with(sleep, Pair(extra[group==2], extra[group==1]))
t <- t.test(sleep2 ~ 1, data = sleep)
```

```{r sleeplik, echo=FALSE}
maxlrSleep <- with(t, tTOmaxlik(statistic, df=parameter)[['maxlik']]/
                     (2*dt(statistic,df=parameter)))
```

The $t$-statistic is `r round(t$statistic,2)`, with $p$ = 
`r round(t$p.value,4)`.  The $p$-value translates to a maximum
likelihood ratio that equals `r round(maxlrSleep,1)`, which
suggests a very clear difference in effectiveness, in favour
of drug 2.

It does then seem clear that drug B gives a bigger increase
in hours of sleep. How sure can we be that it is large
enough to be of substantial consequence?

### A test that sets $\mu$ = 0.8 hours as the baseline {-}

Suppose, now, that 0.8 hours difference is set as the 
minimum that is of interest.  As we are satisfied
that drug B gives a bigger increase, and we wish to
check the strength of evidence for an increase that is
0.8 hours ofÂ more, a one-sided test is appropriate.
Figure \@ref(fig:DOmaxlr)A compares the densities.

```{r cutoff, echo=FALSE}
tinfo <- t.test(sleep2 ~ 1, mu=0.8, alternative = 'greater')
t <- tinfo[['statistic']]; df <- tinfo[['parameter']]

print(gph1, position=c(0,0,0.55,1))

Calculations can be done thus:

```{r cutoff, echo=TRUE, eval=FALSE}
```
The $t$-statistic is `r round(tinfo$statistic,2)`, with $p$ = 
`r round(tinfo$p.value,3)`. The maximum ratio of the likelihoods, 
given in Figure \@ref(fig:DOmaxlr)A as 3.5, is much smaller 
than the value of $\frac{1-p}{p}$ = `r round(tinfo$p.value^{-1}-1,1)`.

The normal probability plot shows a clear departure from
normality. Â At best, the $p$-values give ballpark
indications.  

There are other ways to calculate a likelihood ratio.
In principle, one might calculate the average for all
values where $\bar{d}$ is greater than the cutoff.
This, however, requires an assumed distribution for
$\bar{d}$ under the alternative.  It can never exceed 
the maximum value, calculated as in Figure \@ref(fig:DOmaxlr)A

# Likelihood ratio and false positive risk

## What is the definitive question?

Comments in @berkson1942tests highlight the point that 
$p$-values relate only to what can be expected under the NULL

> If an event has occurred, the definitive question is not, 
`Is this an event which would be rare if the null hypothesis 
is true?â but âIs there an alternative hypothesis under which 
the event would be relatively frequent?'

By contrast, likelihood ratio statistics do address what
Berkson identifies as "the definitive question". 

## Density curves, under the NULL, and under the alternative

Subsection \@ref(wear) gave the following statistical summary
information, for the ten observations in the shoe wear dataset:
```{r all10, echo=FALSE}
print(prettyNum(unlist(shoeStats), digits=2, dropTrailing=TRUE),
      quote=FALSE)
```

Here, in order to obtain a graph where the features
of interest show up more clearly, we will take the first
seven observations only from the shoe wear dataset.
This is done for purposes of illustration only -- the
analysis that properly reflects the data is the analysis
that is based on all 10 observations.
```{r shoes7, echo=FALSE}
wear7 <- with(MASS::shoes, rbind(A, B, d=B-A))[,1:7]
library(magrittr)
shoeStat7 <- wear7['d',] %>% 
  {list(Mean=mean(.), SD=sd(.), n=length(.))} %$%
  {c(., SEM=SD/sqrt(n), t=Mean*sqrt(n)/SD)} %$%
  {c(., pval=2*pt(t, df=n-1, lower.tail=FALSE), df=n-1)}
colnames(wear7) <- rep("",7)
print(wear7[3,,drop=FALSE])
cat("\n")
print(prettyNum(unlist(shoeStat7), digits=2, dropTrailing=TRUE),
      quote=FALSE)
```


Figure \@ref(fig:DOshoeDens) compares the density curves, 
under H0 and under an alternative H1 for which the estimated 
mean of the $t$-distribution is $t = \sqrt{n} \bar{d}/s$.
Under the alternative, the $t$-statistic becomes the 
non-centrality parameter. Because this is subject to
sampling error, the distribution is positively skewed
and the mode, which gives the maximum likelihood, is 
to the left of the mean.

```{r cap5, echo=FALSE}
tmath <- "$t$"
pmath <- "$p$"
cap5 <- paste0("Density curves for NULL and for the alternative,
for a two-sided test with ",tmath," = ", round(shoeStat7[['t']],2),
" on ", shoeStat7[['df']]," degrees of freedom.
Vertical lines are placed at the positions that give 
the ",pmath,"-value, here equal to ",round(shoeStat7[['pval']],3),
".  Panel B shows the normal probability 
plot for the `B-A` differences in the dataset.")
```

```{r DOshoeDens, fig.width=5.5, fig.asp=0.6, fig.align='center', fig.cap=cap5, out.width='80%', echo=FALSE}
maxlr7 <- with(shoeStat7, tTOlr::tTOmaxlik(t, df))
maxlrGPH(t=shoeStat7[['t']], df=shoeStat7[['df']],
         tmax=maxlr7[['tmax']], maxlik=maxlr7[['maxlik']],
         twoSided=TRUE, pretitle="Maximum Likelihood Ratio = ")
```

<!-- ```{r peqpval, echo=FALSE} -->
<!-- p <- shoeStats[['pval']] -->
<!-- df <- shoeStats[['df']] -->
<!-- t <- shoeStats[['t']] -->
<!-- ``` -->

The function `tTOlr::tTOmaxlik()` can be used to calculate
the maximum likelihood under the alternative, at the same
time calculating the maximum likelihood ratio.  For Figure
\@ref(fig:DOshoeDens), degrees of freedom are 
`r shoeStat7[['df']]`, and the $t$-statistic is 
`r round(shoeStat7[['t']],3)`.

Calculations that give the maximum likelihood under the
alternative, the maximum likelihood ratio, and other 
statistical information, then proceed thus:

```{r maxlr7, echo=2:3, eval=TRUE}
t <- shoeStat7[['t']]
stats7 <- list(t=2.256, df=6)  # t is rounded to 2dp
maxlr7 <- with(stats7, tTOlr::tTOmaxlik(t, df))
```
The values returned, to three significant figures are:
```{r sig3, echo=FALSE}
print(setNames(as.character(c(round(unlist(maxlr7)[1:2], 3),
                signif(unlist(maxlr7)[3], 3))), 
               names(maxlr7)), quote=FALSE)
```

Whereas the $t$-statistic was `r round(t,3)`, the maximum
likelihood estimate for the difference from the NULL, on the
scale of the $t$-statistic, was `r round(maxlr7[['tmax']],3)`

Likelihood ratios offer useful insights on what $p$-values
may mean in practice.  
In the absence of contextual information that gives an 
indication of the size of the difference that is of 
practical importance, the ratio of the maximum likelihood 
when the NULL is false to the likelihood when the NULL is 
true gives a sense of the meaning that can be placed on a 
$p$-value.  If information is available on the prior 
probability, or if a guess can be made, it can be 
immediately translated into a false positive risk statistic.

Likelihood ratio statistics directly address the question
whether, under an alternative hypothesis, the observed 
data would be relatively more likely.  They are, 
for this reason, in principle preferable to $p$-values.
They are important, both for the light that they shed on 
$p$-values, and as alternatives to $p$-values.

## Maximum likelihood ratio versus $p$-value

As noted earlier, the maximum likelihood ratio is
calculated by dividing the maximum likelihood for 
the alternative by the likelihood for the NULL.

```{r cap3, eval=TRUE, echo=FALSE}
cap3 <- 'Ratio of the maximum likelihood under the alternative
to the likelihood under the NULL, for three different 
choices of $p$-value, for a range of sample sizes, and for a 
range of degrees of freedom.'
```

```{r pTOmaxlrGPH, echo=FALSE, fig.width=6, fig.asp=0.6, fig.cap=cap3, fig.pos='ht', out.width='100%'}
lrP <- data.frame(df=rep(c(2,seq(from=5, to=50,by=5)),4), 
                  pval=rep(c(.05,.025,.01,.005),c(11,11,11,11)),
                  tstat=numeric(44), lr=numeric(44))
for(i in 1:nrow(lrP)){
  t <- qt(1-lrP$pval[i]/2,df=lrP$df[i])
  dens0 <- dt(t, df = lrP$df[i])
  lrP[i,c('tstat','lr')] <- c(t, tTOmaxlik(t = t, df = lrP$df[i])[["maxlik"]]/(2*dens0))  ## NB: Two-sided
}
atx <- c(2,(1:5)*10)
aty <- list(c(3,4,5,6,8,10,25,50,100),c(2,2.5,3,4,5))
laby <- list(paste(aty[[1]]),paste(aty[[2]]))
gph <- xyplot(lr+tstat ~ df, groups=pval, data=lrP, type=c("p","l"),
              auto.key=list(columns=4), 
              xlab="Degrees of freedom", ylab="",
                strip=strip.custom(factor.levels=c("Maximum likelihood ratio","t-statistic")),
                scales=list(x=list(at=atx),
                            y=list(relation='free', log=TRUE,
                                   at=aty, labels=laby)), 
                par.settings=lattice::simpleTheme(pch=c(1,2,3,16), alpha.line=0.4,lwd=0.5, lty=2))
update(gph,axis=latticeExtra::axis.grid)
```

Figure \@ref(fig:pTOmaxlrGPH) gives the maximum likelihood
ratio equivalents of $p$-values, for a range of sample sizes,
for $p$-values that equal 0.05, 0.01, and 0.001, and for a
range of degrees of freedom.  The comparison is always 
between a point NULL (here $\mu$=0) and the alternative 
$\mu$ > 0.  For 6 or more degrees of freedom $p$ = 0.05 
translates to a ratio that is less than 5.0, while it is less 
than 4.5 for 10 or more degrees of freedom, and less than 4
for 13 or more degrees of freedom.

The ratio is higher for low degrees of freedom because of
the way that the shape of the distribution changes.  Other
uncertainties enter.  Departures from assumptions are of
greatest consequence in those contexts where distributional
asssumptions will detect only the most extreme departures
from assumptions --- i.e., when degrees of freedom are
small.  Experience with comparable historical data can be
especially useful in those circumstances.

An observed $p = 0.05$ can be taken as representative
of $p$-values that range from $\alpha$ = 0.1 to 0,
with odds against that are 9:1.  This is commonly seen
as providing strong evidence in favour of the alternative.
The case for rejecting the NULL looks much less convincing
when this is translated into a maximum likelihood ratio of 
the order or 4 or 5 in favour of the alternative.

Rather than focusing on the maximum likelihood ratio,
one can compare the point NULL that we have been assuming
with a point alternative, and a likelihood ratio that will
usually be smaller.

## False positive risk versus $p$-value

The false positive risk is the probability, under one or other 
decision strategy, that what is identified as a positive will 
be a false positive?  False positive risk calculations require 
an assessment of the prior probability `prior` = $\pi$ of the 
alternative H1, with `1-prior` as the prior probability of H0.
In the absence of such an assessment, all that can be said is
that the NULL hypothesis becomes less likely as the $p$-value 
becomes smaller. 

For any value of the maximum likelihood ratio `lr`, the false 
positive risk can then be calculated as 
`(1-prior)/(1-prior+prior*lr)`. 

```{r cap4, eval=TRUE, echo=FALSE}
cap4 <- 'False positive risk, for three different choices
of $p$-value, for a range of sample sizes, and for a 
range of degrees of freedom.'
```

```{r pTOfprGPH, echo=FALSE, fig.width=6, fig.asp=0.6, fig.cap=cap4, fig.pos='ht', out.width='100%'}
lrP[,"fpr0.1"] <- (1-0.1)/(1-0.1+0.1*lrP[,"lr"])
lrP[,"fpr0.5"] <- (1-0.5)/(1-0.5+0.5*lrP[,"lr"])
aty <- list(c(0.025,0.05,0.1,0.2,0.4),c(0.004,0.01, 0.04,0.1,0.4))
laby <- list(paste(aty[[1]]),paste(aty[[2]]))
gph <- xyplot(fpr0.1+fpr0.5 ~ df, groups=pval, data=lrP, auto.key=list(columns=4), 
                xlab="Degrees of freedom",
                ylab="False positive risk",
                strip=strip.custom(factor.levels=c("Prior =Â 0.1","Prior = 0.5")),
                scales=list(y=list(relation='free', log=TRUE,
                                   at=aty, labels=laby)), 
                par.settings=lattice::simpleTheme(pch=16))
update(gph,axis=latticeExtra::axis.grid)
```

Figure \@ref(fig:pTOfprGPH) gives the false positive risk
equivalents of $p$-values, for a range of sample sizes,
for $p$-values that equal 0.05, 0.01, and 0.001, for a
range of degrees of freedom, and for priors $\pi$ = 0.1
and $\pi$ = 0.5 for the probibility of H1.

# Power -- how well does a planned experiment discriminate?

The discussion will assume that we are testing $\mu$ = 0
against $\mu$ > 0 (one-sided test),  or $\mu \neq 0$
(two-sided test). (As noted earlier, it is often more 
appropriate to use as the baseline a value of $\mu$ that
is non-zero.  Working with a non-zero baseline is simplest 
for a one-sided test.)

For purposes of designing an experiment, researchers should want
confidence that the experiment is capable of detecting differences
in the mean, or (for an experiment that generates  one-sample data)
the mean difference, that are more than trivial in magnitude.

## The power of a $t$ or other statistical test

The power is the probability that, if H1 is true, the calculated
$p$-value will be smaller than a chosen threshold $\alpha$.
Experiments that have low power can waste effort, to little
purpose.

For designing an experiment, setting a power is usually done
relative to a baseline difference of 0.  There is, however,
no reason why power should not be set relative to a baseline
that is greater than 0. Once experimental results are in,
what is more relevant than the power is the minimum mean
difference or (for a two-sample test) difference in means 
that one would like to be able to detect.

```

Figure \@ref(fig:pwr-gph) is designed to illustrate the notion
of power graphically.  The densities shown are for a two-sample 
comparison (equal variances) with $n = 19$ in each sample.
Calculations proceed by first calculating the separation
between means required, with $\alpha=0.05$, to give a
power that equals 0.8, and from this the non-centrality
parameter, thus:

```{r power, echo=1:7, eval=FALSE,ref.label='pwr-gph'}
```

The comparison is between densities of $t$-statistics, both
with degrees of freedom `r df`, the first with 
noncentrality parameter `ncp` = 0, and the second with
noncentrality parameter `ncp` = `delta/sed` = `r round(ncp,3)` .

The same graph will result irrespective of the standard
deviation.  It is at the same time the graph that will be
obtained for a single sample $t$-test with $n = 37$, now
with `delta` equal to the mean difference rather than the
difference in means.  The two density curves are in each
case separated, on the scale of the $t$-statistic, by the
amount required for the test to have a \textit{power} 
that equals 0.8 for $\alpha$ = 0.05.  

Here are the calculations:
```{r power, eval=FALSE}
```

Once experimental results are obtained and a $p$-value has been
calculated, the alternative of interest is the minimum difference 
$\delta$ in means (or, in the one-sample case, mean difference) 
that was set before the experiment as of interest to the 
researcher.

As an example of a power calculation, suppose that we want to 
have an 80\% probability of detecting, at the $\alpha$ = 0.05
level, a difference $\delta$ of 1.4 or more. Assume, for
purposes of an example, that the experiment will give us data 
for a two-sample two=sided test. Assume further that the 
standard deviation of treatment measurements is thought to be 
around 1.  As this is just a guesstimate, we build in
a modest margin of error, and take the standard deviation to 
be 1.5 for purposes of calculating the sample size.  We then 
do the calculation:
```{r powercalc}
power.t.test(type='two.sample', alternative='two.sided', power=0.8,
             sig.level=0.05, sd=1.5, delta=1.4)[['n']]
```

With the results in, the relevant alternative to H0, for
purposes of calculating a likelihood ratio, has
$\delta$ = 1.4.  Suppose, then, that the experimentalÂ 
results yield a standard deviation ofÂ 1.2, assuming
that the standard deviation is the same for both treatments.

Figure \@ref(fig:lrVSpGPH) (left panel) plots maximum 
likelihood ratios, and likelihood ratios, for the choices 
$\delta$ = 1.0 and $\delta$ = 1.4, against $p$-values.
Results are for a two-sample two-sided test with $n$ = 19 
in each sample.  Results are presented for $\delta$ = 1.0
as well as for $\delta$ = 1.4, in order to show how the
likelihood ratio changes when $\delta$ changes.

The power, calculated relative to a specific choice of $\alpha$,
is an important consideration when an experiment is designed. 
The aim is, for a simple randomized trial of the type considered
here, to ensure an acceptably high probability that a treatment
effect $\delta$ that is large enough to be of scientific interest,
will be detectable given a threshold $\alpha$ for the resultant
$p$-value.  Once experimentalÂ results are available, the focus
should shift to assessing the strength of the evidence that
the treatment effect is large enough to be of scientific interest,
i.e., that it is of magnitude $\delta$ or more.

Any treatment effect, however small, contributes to shifting the
balance of probability between the NULL and the alternative.
By contrast, the maximum likelihood ratio depends only on the
estimated treatment effect.  What is really of interest, 
as has just been noted, is the strength of evidence that the
treatment effect is of magnitude $\delta$ or more.

## False positive risk, when $\alpha$ is used as cutoff

The use of a cutoff $\alpha$, as a basis for a 
decision-making strategy, is a less nuanced use of the
evidence than when there is attention to the specific
$p$-value or, equivqlently, to the $t$-statistic.
Assume that experiments are designed to have a
power $P_w$ to accept H1 when $p <= \alpha$.  Then the 
false positive risk is:
$$
\frac{\alpha(1-\pi)}{\alpha(1-\pi)+\pi P_w}
$$

In the case where $\pi$ = 0.5, and $P_w$ is 0.8 or more,
this is always less than 1.25 $\alpha$.  Note again that
what is modeled here are the properties of a strategy
for choosing between H0 and H1.  Thus, with $\alpha$ = 0.5,
it makes no distinction between, for example, $p$ = 0.05
and $p$ = 0.01 or less.

### What choices of cutoff $\alpha$, and of power, make sense? {-}

The conventional choice has been $\alpha$ = 0.05,
with 0.8 for the power. In recent years, in the debate over
reproducibility in science, a strong case has been made for
a choice of $\alpha$ = 0.01 or $\alpha$ = 0.005 for the cutoff.
Such a more stringent cutoff makes sense for purposes of
deciding on the required sample size.  It does not deal with the
larger problem of binary decision making on the basis of a single
experiment.

A higher power alters the tradeoff between the type I error
$\alpha$, and the type II error $\beta$ = 1 - $P_w$,
where $P_w$ is the power.  In moving from $P_w$ = 0.8 
to $P_w$ = 0.9 while holding the sample size constant, 
one is increasing the separation between the distribution 
for the NULL and the distribution for the alternative H1.

# How should results be reported?

$P$-values have come to have a central role in the reporting of 
scientific results. It is commonly assumed that an individual
$p$-value that equals 0.05 provides 19 to 1 evidence against the 
NULL hypothesis, and in favour of the alternative. Two points are

* The probability to which it most directly relates is the
probability of obtaining such a result, given the NULL
* For this purpose, the relevant probability is 0.1, not 0.05

The maximum likelihood ratio for the alternative against
the NULL depends on the degrees of freedom.  It is less than 
4.5 for degrees of freedom greater than 5.  

Results should come with evidence of relevant checks on
distributional assumptions.  Where degrees of freedom are
small (e.g., 4 or less), and there is no evidence from
comparable data from earlier studies on which to rely,
checks are in general unlikely to be effective. The
uncertainty that this generates should be acknowledged.

Meaningful data are a richer source of information than
can be satisfactorily summarized in a single statistic.
Consider the use of multiple forms of statistical
summary, each offering its own perspective, and supported
by relevant graphs.
